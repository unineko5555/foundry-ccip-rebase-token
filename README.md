# - [Cross-Chain Rebase Token](#cross-chain-rebase-token)

1. A protocol that allows users to deposit into a vault and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.

2. The rebase token's balance of function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time.
    - Balance increase linearly with time
    - mint tokens to our users every time they perform an action (minting, burning, transfering, or.... bringing)

3. Interest rate
   - Individually set an interest rate for each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault.
   - This global interest rate can only decrease to incentive/erward early adopters.
   - Increase token adoption
